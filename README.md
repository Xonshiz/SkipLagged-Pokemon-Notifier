Grab the [Windows Binary Here](https://github.com/Xonshiz/SkipLagged-Pokemon-Notifier/raw/master/Pokemon%20Notifier.rar)!

#How To Use
Using this script is easy AF!

1.) Open the "Pokemon.txt" file and type the name of pokemon you're looking for, save and close the file.

2.) Run the "Pokemon Notifier.exe" from Command Prompt.

3.) It'll look for pokemon and restart if it doesn't find it!
